# SWN Core Library

This core library is intended to be used both by a CLI and a web application. It contains the fundamental object definitions used by this system, based on the roleplaying game rules for [Stars Without Number, Revised Edition](https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/collections/stars-without-number) by [Sine Nomine Publishing](https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/).

This library will not be of much use on its own. Once I have started the CLI I will provide more documentation there.

I am not a Rust expert. Quite the opposite, I'm using this as an opportunity to learn how to make  full-stack application in Rust. So if you see any issues with my code, let me know!
